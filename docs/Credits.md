# Credits
* **wL** - I looked through their source a bit in the beginning to understand how some of  the concepts are approached
* **The Apollo team** - Apollo has been a crucial source of information for me regarding various different aspects of the protocol and a method of approach for certain features (such as their `WalkingQueue` and just about all frame layouts).
* **The Hyperion team** - Hyperion was my go-to during the earlier days of the project. It's documented well enough and has proved itself to be an very useful source of information.
* **Ale8k** - We both worked together to figure out login, rendering models, some movement, and multiplayer. I referenced nodescape quite a bit for frame 81 and movement.
* **Major** - Using his refactored client to this day. Apollo is also a huge source of information.
* **Graham** - Tons of thread posts, general information, discord messages, and Hyperion along with Apollo were large sources of information for various game aspects. I used Hyperion, Apollo, and RuneSource as a reference for map-related things (such as `Locations`, `Positions`, `Regions`, etc.)
* **Blakeman6192** - Basically the same as above. Tons of thread posts, general information, and RuneSource. I used RuneSource as a reference for it's `StreamBuffer` object and map-related things.
* **Stuart** - I used his ItemDefinition dump as a source of all data within the project's Item Definition table.
* **MITB** - I used srcAllDummiesRemoved for early tests before I found Major's client. I occasionally use this client if I want to double check how something looks or how the client behaves.

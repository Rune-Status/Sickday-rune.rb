# Credits
* **wL** - I looked through their source a bit in the beginning to understand how some of  the concepts are approached
* **Major** - Using his refactored client to this day. Apollo is also a huge source of information.
* **Graham** - Tons of thread posts, general information, discord messages, and Hyperion along with Apollo were large sources of information for various game aspects. I used Hyperion, Apollo, and RuneSource as a reference for map-related things (such as `Locations`, `Positions`, `Regions`, etc.)
* **Blakeman6192** - Basically the same as a bove. Tons of thread posts, general information, and RuneSource. I used RuneSource as a reference for it's `StreamBuffer` object and map-related things.
* **Ale8k** - We both worked together to figure out login, rendering models, some movement, and multiplayer. I referenced nodescape quite a bit for frame 81 and movement.
